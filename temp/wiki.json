  "project_summary": "This project appears to be a Visual Studio Code extension that serves to generate wikis for both Python and JavaScript codebases and manage certain aspects of user interface interaction within the editor.\n\n- The `extension.ts` file drives the core features of the extension. It oversees the creation of web views for user dashboards and project wikis, handles code chunk highlighting, manages session times, provides hover information, and integrates with Puppeteer for website thumbnail generation.\n\n- The `wiki/wiki_python.ts` and `wiki/wiki_javascript.ts` files are responsible for generating wikis for Python and JavaScript code respectively. The former creates a command to build a graph based on Python code execution, while the latter employs Madge to generate a dependency graph and AI summarization for project and file summaries.\n\n- The `api.ts` file is in charge of specific API calls that update cursor position, chunks, and wiki content. It relies on functions from the `chunk-algo.ts` file.\n\n- The `chunk-algo.ts` file defines functions that handle code chunk operations and decorations, useful in code highlighting and chunk updates.\n\n- Lastly, the `code_describer.d.ts` file lays out type definitions to help in creating summaries of code files and projects.\n\nOverall, the project seems to assist the user with understanding the structure of their code and improving navigation by providing a summarization and visualization of the codebase.\n",
  "wiki/code_describer.d.ts": "The `code_describer.d.ts` file provides type definitions for functions that summarize code files and projects. It is referenced by the `wiki` files for JavaScript and Python. It helps in creating summaries of code files and projects by utilizing the provided functions.",
  "api.ts": "The \"api.ts\" file contains functions for updating cursor position, chunks, and wiki content via API calls. It depends on the \"chunk-algo.ts\" file for hashing functions and logic.",
  "wiki/wiki_python.ts": "The `wiki_python.ts` file contains a command to create a graph based on the Python code. It uses the `spawn` module to execute a Python script (`create_graphh.py`) with the path of the open Python file as an argument. This functionality is triggered by a command registered with Visual Studio Code.",
  "wiki/wiki_javascript.ts": "This file defines a command to generate a wiki for JavaScript code. It utilizes Madge to create a dependency graph of the codebase, summarizes individual files using AI, and then generates a wiki.json file with project and file summaries.",
  "chunk-algo.ts": "`chunk-algo.ts` defines functions for handling code chunk operations and decorations, used by `extension.ts` for code highlighting and by `api.ts` for updating chunks. It also interacts with VS Code editor functions and manages hash generation for code chunks.",
  "extension.ts": "`extension.ts` contains the main functionalities for the VS Code extension, such as creating web views for user dashboard and project wiki, handling code chunk highlighting, managing session times, providing hover information, and integrating with Puppeteer for generating website thumbnails."
